For years, I would retire early to bed. Sometimes, barely my candle flame had extinguished before my eyes would close so quickly I couldn’t even say "I'm going to sleep." And half an hour later, the thought that it was time for sleep came to me; I wanted to put down the volume I believed still held in my hands and blow out its light; I hadn't stopped thinking while asleep, but these thoughts had taken on a peculiar turn.  I felt like I was myself the subject of the book: a church, a quartet, the rivalry between François Ier and Charles Quint. This belief lasted only a few seconds after waking; it didn’t shock my reason, but weighed down like scales on my eyes, preventing me from realizing the candle had gone out. Then it began to become incomprehensible as if an existence before this one was fading away; the book's subject seemed to detach from me and I could choose whether or not to apply myself to it; instantly, I regained my sight, and I was quite surprised to find a gentle and restful darkness all around me for my eyes, but perhaps even more so for my mind. It looked as if something had been created without cause or reason, an incomprehensible thing, truly obscure.  I wondered what time it must be; I heard the whistling of trains that, however far away they were, like a bird's song in a forest, sounded across distances, and described the vast emptiness of the countryside where the traveler hurried to the next station; and this small path he was following would be etched into his memory by the excitement at being on new ground, meeting new people, engaged in unusual activities, the recent farewells under the foreign lamp that continues to linger in his silence as night falls. The approaching comfort of returning home awaited him.

**Explanation:**  
The passage is a beautiful example of literary prose. Here's a breakdown: 

* **Setting:** The scene is established through sensory detail—the sounds of trains, the darkness of night, and the imagery of the country path.
* **Themes:** It touches on themes of sleep, introspection, the passing of time, and the mystery of life and existence.
* **Voice:** The narrator's voice is introspective and poetic. 
* **Style:**  The passage uses literary devices like metaphors ("scales on my eyes," "something was created without cause or reason"), similes (e.g., "trains that sound across distances"), personification, and evocative descriptions of the setting.

This translation aims to capture the essence of the original French while preserving its poetic and metaphorical style.

For years, I went to bed early. Sometimes, barely as my candle was extinguished, my eyes would close so quickly that I didn’t even have time to say “I am falling asleep.” And a half hour later, the thought of it being time for sleep woke me up; I wanted to place the volume I believed to still be in my hands and blow away my light. I hadn't stopped while I slept from thinking about what I had read, but these thoughts were taking on a peculiar turn; it seemed to me that I was myself the subject of the book: an church, a quartet, the rivalry between Francis I and Charles Quint. This belief lasted for a few seconds before my waking mind; it did not shock my reason, but weighed down on my eyes, preventing me from realizing that the candle wasn't lit. Then it started to become incomprehensible, like after the metamorphosis where thoughts of an existence prior came back; the subject of the book detached from me, I was free to apply myself to it or not; immediately I regained vision and I was quite surprised to find around me a peaceful darkness, soft and restful for my eyes, but perhaps more so for my mind. It appeared to my mind as something without cause, incomprehensible, like an unseen thing. I wondered what time it might be; I could hear the whistling of trains that were far away or near, like a bird singing in a forest, crossing distances by carrying them with their songs; and the small path he was taking would be etched in his memory by the excitement he felt about new places, unfamiliar acts, the recent chat, and the farewells beneath the foreign lamp, still following him in the silence of the night, to the soft future of going home.

For years, I went to bed early. Sometimes, barely as my candle flame extinguished, my eyes would close so quickly that I couldn’t even say to myself, “I am falling asleep.” And a half hour later, the thought that it was time for sleep would wake me; I wanted to place the volume I believed to still have in my hands and blow away my light. I hadn't stopped while sleeping from pondering what I had read, but these thoughts took a special turn: I felt as if I was myself the subject of the book – an church, a quartet, the rivalry of François Ier and Charles-Quint. This belief survived for only a few seconds before my awakening; it did not contradict my reason, but weighed on my eyes like scales and prevented me from realizing that the candle had been left off.  Then, it began to become unintelligible, as after a reincarnation the thoughts of an earlier existence – the subject of the book detached itself from me; I was free to apply myself to it or not. As soon as I regained sight, I was amazed to find around me a dark, soothing and restful obscurity for my eyes, but perhaps even more for my mind. To which it appeared as an inexplicable thing, without cause, incomprehensible, like something really obscure. I wondered what time it might be; I could hear the whistle of trains that from far or near, like the call of a bird in a forest, spanning distances, described the vast expanse of the deserted countryside where the traveler hastened toward the next station; and the small path he follows will be etched in his memory by the excitement for new places, unusual acts, the recent conversation and the farewells beneath the foreign lamp that still follows him in silence during the night, the proximity of a return. 



This translation attempts to maintain the original French's style, while preserving its nuances and poetic elements.

For long time I would lie down early. Sometimes, barely extinguishing my candle, my eyes would close so fast that I didn’t have time to say "I am falling asleep." And a half hour later, the thought that it was time for sleep would wake me; I wanted to put the volume I believed I still had in my hands and blow out my light. I hadn't stopped reading while sleeping from contemplating what I had read, but these thoughts took on a somewhat unusual turn: I seemed to be myself the subject of the book – an church, a quartet, the rivalry between François Ier and Charles-Quint. This belief survived for a few seconds against my waking; it did not shock my reason, but weighed upon my eyes like scales, preventing me from realizing that the candle was not lit. Then it started to become unintelligible to me, like after reincarnation, thoughts of an earlier existence; the subject of the book detached itself from me, I was free to apply or not to it; immediately I regained my sight and I was surprised to find around me a soft and restful darkness for my eyes, but perhaps even more so for my mind. To him it appeared like something without cause, incomprehensible, as a truly obscure thing. I wondered what time it was; the whistle of trains, closer or further away, like the song of an bird in a forest that rises over distances, described to me the expanse of the deserted countryside where the traveler is hurrying towards the next station; and the small path he follows will be etched in his memory by the excitement he owes to new places, to unusual acts, to the recent talk and farewells beneath the foreign lamp following him still in silence at night, to the gentle proximity of return. 

**Notes:**

* The passage is dense with imagery and symbolism.  
* The translation aims for clarity while preserving some of the original's poetic qualities. 
* Words like "obscurité" and "esprit" are translated based on how they would be understood in English, even if they don't have direct equivalents in modern English.

I hadn't stopped thinking during sleep about what I had just read, but these thoughts had taken a rather peculiar turn; it seemed to me that I myself was what the book was talking about: a church, a quartet, the rivalry of Francis I and Charles V. This belief lingered for a few seconds after waking; it did not shock my reason, but weighed on me like scales, preventing my eyes from realizing that the candle wasn't lit. Then it started to become unintelligible, like the thoughts of a previous existence after metamorphosis; the subject of the book detached itself from me, and I was free to apply myself to it or not. Immediately, I regained my sight, and I was quite surprised to find myself surrounded by an obscurity, both pleasant and restful for my eyes, but perhaps even more so for my mind, which perceived it as something without cause, incomprehensible, truly obscure. I wondered what time it might be; I heard the whistle of trains which, at varying distances, like the song of a bird in a forest, revealed the extent of the deserted countryside where the traveler hastens towards the next station; and the small path he follows will be engraved in his memory by the excitement he owes to new places, unaccustomed acts, recent conversation, and farewells under the foreign lamp which still follows him in the silence of the night, to the sweetness soon approaching of returning home.

Here is the translation into English:

For a long time I went to bed early. Sometimes, no sooner had my candle been blown out than my eyes would shut so quickly that I wouldn't even have time to say to myself: "I'm falling asleep." And just half an hour later, the thought that it was time to seek sleep would wake me up; I wanted to put down the volume that I believed I still held in my hands and blow out my light; I had not ceased thinking during my sleep about what I had just read, but these thoughts had taken on a slightly particular tone; it seemed to me that I was myself the subject of the work: an church, a quartet, the rivalry between Francis I and Charles V. This belief survived for several seconds after waking up; it did not shock my reason, but weighed down on my eyes like scales and prevented them from realizing that the nightlight was not lit.

Then it began to become unintelligible to me, like the thoughts of a previous existence after metempsychosis; the subject of the book detached itself from me, I was free to apply myself to it or not; immediately I regained my sight and I was very surprised to find around me an obscurity, sweet and restful for my eyes but perhaps even more so for my mind, which appeared to me as a thing without cause, incomprehensible, like a truly dark thing.

I wondered what time it could be; I heard the whistle of trains that, more or less distant, like the song of a bird in a forest, gave me an idea of the distances and described to me the extent of the deserted countryside where the traveler hastens towards the next station. And the little road he follows will be carved into his memory by the excitement that it owes to new places, to unusual acts, to recent conversation, and to farewells under a strange lamp that still follow him in the silence of the night, as well as the sweetness of the upcoming return.

Longtemps, je me couchais de bonne heure. Parfois, à peine ma bougie éteinte, mes yeux se fermaient si vite que je n’avais pas le temps de me dire : « Je m’endors. » Et une demi-heure après, la pensée qu’il était temps de chercher le sommeil me réveillait ; je voulais poser le volume que j’estimais encore dans les mains et souffler ma lumière ; je n’avais pas cessé en dormant de faire des réflexions sur ce que j’avais lu, mais ces réflexions avaient pris un tour un peu particulier. Il me semblait être moi-même ce dont parlait l’ouvrage : une église, un quatuor, la rivalité de François Ier et de Charles-Quint. Cette croyance survivait quelques secondes à mon réveil ; elle ne choquait pas ma raison mais pesait comme des écailles sur mes yeux qui l’empêchaient de se rendre compte que le bougeoir n’était pas allumé.

Puis cette croyance commençait à me devenir inintelligible, comme après la métempsycose les pensées d’une existence antérieure ; le sujet du livre se détachait de moi et j’étais libre de m’y appliquer ou non. Aussitôt je recouvrais la vue et je n’étais pas étonné de trouver autour de moi une obscurité douce et reposante pour mes yeux, peut-être plus encore pour mon esprit qui lui apparaissait comme une chose sans cause, incompréhensible comme une chose vraiment obscure. Je me demandais quelle heure il pouvait être ; j’entendais le sifflement des trains qui, plus ou moins éloignés, comme le chant d’un oiseau dans une forêt, relevaient les distances et m’étaient descriptifs du paysage désert où le voyageur se hâte vers la station prochaine. Et le petit chemin qu’il suit va être gravé dans son souvenir par l’excitation qu’il doit à de lieux nouveaux, à des actes inaccoutumés, à la causerie récente et aux adieux sous la lampe étrangère qui le suivent encore dans le silence de la nuit, à la douceur prochaine du retour.
