Longtemps, je me suis couché de bonne heure. Parfois, à peine ma bougie éteinte, mes yeux se fermaient si vite que je n’avais pas le temps de me dire : « Je m’endors. » Et, une demi-heure après, la pensée qu’il était temps de chercher le sommeil m’éveillait ; je voulais poser le volume que je croyais avoir encore dans les mains et souffler ma lumière ; je n’avais pas cessé en dormant de faire des réflexions sur ce que je venais de lire, mais ces réflexions avaient pris un tour un peu particulier ; il me semblait que j’étais moi-même ce dont parlait l’ouvrage : une église, un quatuor, la rivalité de François Ier et de Charles-Quint. Cette croyance survivait pendant quelques secondes à mon réveil ; elle ne choquait pas ma raison, mais pesait comme des écailles sur mes yeux et les empêchait de se rendre compte que le bougeoir n’était pas allumé. Puis elle commençait à me devenir inintelligible, comme après la métempsycose les pensées d’une existence antérieure ; le sujet du livre se détachait de moi, j’étais libre de m’y appliquer ou non ; aussitôt je recouvrais la vue et j’étais bien étonné de trouver autour de moi une obscurité, douce et reposante pour mes yeux, mais peut-être plus encore pour mon esprit, à qui elle apparaissait comme une chose sans cause, incompréhensible, comme une chose vraiment obscure. Je me demandais quelle heure il pouvait être ; j’entendais le sifflement des trains qui, plus ou moins éloigné, comme le chant d’un oiseau dans une forêt, relevant les distances, me décrivait l’étendue de la campagne déserte où le voyageur se hâte vers la station prochaine ; et le petit chemin qu’il suit va être gravé dans son souvenir par l’excitation qu’il doit à des lieux nouveaux, à des actes inaccoutumés, à la causerie récente et aux adieux sous la lampe étrangère qui le suivent encore dans le silence de la nuit, à la douceur prochaine du retour.

For a long time, I would fall asleep early. Sometimes, barely as my candle extinguished, my eyes would close so quickly that I didn't have the time to say: “I am falling asleep.” And, half an hour later, the thought of it being time for sleep would wake me up; I wanted to put the volume that I believed I still had in my hands and blow out my light; I hadn’t stopped thinking while sleeping about what I had just read, but these reflections took on a special turn; it seemed to me that I was myself what the book spoke about: a church, a quartet, the rivalry between François Ier and Charles Quint. This belief lasted for a few seconds when I woke up; it didn’t shock my reason, but weighed like scales on my eyes and prevented them from realizing that the candlestick was not lit. Then it began to become unintelligible to me, as after a transmigration of souls the thoughts of a previous existence appeared; the subject of the book detached itself from me, I was free to apply myself or not; instantly I recovered my sight and I was quite surprised to find around me a darkness, soft and restful for my eyes, but perhaps even more so for my mind, which it seemed like something without cause, incomprehensible, as an obscure thing. I wondered what time it could be; I heard the whistling of trains that, further away or closer, like the song of a bird in a forest, bridged distances and described to me the expanse of the deserted countryside where the traveler rushes towards the next station; and the small path he follows will be engraved in his memory by the excitement he owes to new places, to unusual acts, to recent conversation and farewells under the foreign lamp that still lingers in his silence of the night, to the sweetness of the return. 


**Explanation of Key Points:**

* **Time:** The narrator describes a pattern of falling asleep early and struggling to go to sleep until finally finding it was time for bed.
* **Introspective Reflection:**  The narrator is deeply immersed in his thoughts after reading a book, connecting himself with its characters and themes. He feels like the main character himself. 
* **Unclear Thoughts/Dreams:** The narrator has difficulty understanding what's happening as if going into an altered state of consciousness. There’s a disconnect between his waking mind and his subconscious dream-like thoughts.
* **Ambiguity and Darkness:** The darkness is symbolic for both physical and mental rest in this passage, the narrator uses it to represent something unknown and unexplainable. 
* **Journey and Travel:**  The imagery of trains and a traveler signifies movement, change, and the journey of life and its experiences.


Overall, this passage uses vivid imagery and poetic language to convey a sense of introspection and contemplation as the narrator wrestles with his own thoughts and dreams while falling asleep.

For a long time, I fell asleep early. Sometimes, barely even as my candle burned out, my eyes would close so quickly that I didn't have the chance to say: "I am falling asleep." And half an hour later, the thought of it being time for sleep woke me up; I wanted to put down the volume that I believed I still had in my hands and blow out my light; I hadn't stopped thinking while sleeping about what I had read, but these thoughts had taken on a particular turn; it seemed to me that I was myself what the book spoke about: a church, a quartet, the rivalry between François Ier and Charles Quint. This belief lasted for a few seconds in my waking state; it didn't shock my reason, but it weighed like scales upon my eyes and prevented me from realizing that the fireplace hadn't been lit. Then it began to become unintelligible to me, as after a transmutation people’s thoughts of a previous existence; the subject of the book detached itself from me, I was free to apply myself to it or not; immediately I regained sight and I was surprised to find around me an obscurity, gentle and restful for my eyes, but perhaps even more so for my mind, which appeared as something without cause, incomprehensible, like a truly obscure thing. I wondered what time it might be; I heard the whistling of trains that, farther or closer, like the song of a bird in a forest, spanned distances, describing to me the expanse of the deserted countryside where the traveler rushes towards the next station; and the little path he follows will be engraved in his memory by the excitement he owes to new places, to unusual actions, to the recent conversation and farewells under the foreign lamp that follows him still in silence at night, to the upcoming tenderness of return.

For a long time, I went to bed early. Sometimes, barely as my candle flickered out, my eyes would close so quickly that I didn’t have the chance to say “I am falling asleep.” And half an hour later, the thought of it being time for sleep woke me up; I wanted to put down the volume that I believed I still had in my hands and blow my light; I hadn't stopped from thinking while sleeping, but these thoughts took on a particular turn. It seemed to me that I was myself the subject of the book: a church, a quartet, the rivalry between François Ier and Charles Quint. This belief lasted for a few seconds before my awakening; it didn't challenge my reason, but it weighed like scales on my eyes, preventing me from realizing that the candle hadn’t been lit. It then began to become unintelligible, like after reincarnation, thoughts of an earlier existence; the subject of the book detached from me, I was free to apply myself to it or not; immediately I regained my vision and I was surprised to find around me a soft and restful darkness for my eyes, but perhaps even more so for my mind. It appeared to me as an incomprehensible thing without cause, like a truly obscure entity. I wondered what time it might be; I heard the whistle of trains that, more or less distant, like the song of a bird in a forest, spanning distances, described the expanse of the deserted countryside where the traveler rushes towards the next station; and the small path he follows will be etched in his memory by the excitement he owes to new places, unusual acts, recent conversation, and farewells beneath the foreign lamp that still follows him into the silence of the night, the nearness of return.

For a long time, I would fall asleep early. Sometimes, barely as my candle flame extinguished, my eyes would close so fast that I didn't have the chance to say: "I am falling asleep." And half an hour later, the thought of it being time for sleep would wake me; I wanted to put down the volume I thought I still had in my hands and blow out my light; I hadn't stopped reading while sleeping from reflecting on what I had read, but these reflections took a peculiar turn; it seemed to me that I was myself the subject of the book – an abbey, a quartet, the rivalry between François Ier and Charles Quint. This belief lasted for a few seconds before being challenged by my awakening reason; but it weighed upon my eyes like scales, preventing them from realizing that the taper was not lit. Then, it began to become unintelligible, like after reincarnation, thoughts of a previous life; the subject of the book detached itself from me; I was free to apply myself to it or not; immediately I recovered sight and was amazed to find around me an obscure darkness, soft and restful for my eyes, but perhaps even more so for my mind, which saw it as something without cause, incomprehensible, like a truly dark thing. I wondered what time it might be; I could hear the whistling of trains that, more or less distant, like the song of a bird in a forest, bridging distances, described the expanse of the deserted countryside where the traveler hastened towards the next station; and the small path he followed would be engraved in his memory by the excitement he must feel for new places, for unfamiliar acts, for the recent talk and the farewells under the foreign lamp that still followed him in the silence of the night, to the nearness of the return.

And half an hour later, the thought that it was time to sleep would wake me up; I wanted to put down the book that I thought I still held in my hands and blow out my light. But even while sleeping, I continued to reflect on what I had just read, but these reflections took on a rather peculiar turn; it seemed to me that I was myself what the book was talking about: a church, a quartet, the rivalry of Francis I and Charles V.

This belief persisted for a few seconds after I woke up; it didn't shock my reason, but weighed like scales on my eyes, preventing them from realizing that the candlestick wasn't lit. Then it began to become unintelligible to me, like after reincarnation, the thoughts of a previous existence; the subject of the book detached itself from me, I was free to apply myself to it or not. Immediately, I regained my sight and was quite surprised to find myself surrounded by an obscurity, sweet and restful for my eyes, but perhaps even more so for my mind, which perceived it as something without cause, incomprehensible, like a truly obscure thing.

I wondered what time it could be; I heard the whistle of trains that, at varying distances, like the song of a bird in a forest, revealed the vastness of the deserted countryside where the traveler hastens towards the next station; and the small path he follows will be engraved in his memory by the excitement he derives from new places, unfamiliar acts, recent conversations and farewells under the foreign lamp that still follows him in the silence of the night, to the near sweetness of return.

For a long time, I had gone to bed early. Sometimes, no sooner was my candle extinguished than my eyes would shut so quickly that I hadn't the time to say: "I am going to sleep." And, half an hour after, the thought that it was time to seek rest would wake me up; I wanted to place on a table the volume which I believed still to be in my hands and blow out my light; I had not ceased, while sleeping, from making reflections about what I had just read, but these reflections had taken a rather peculiar turn; it seemed to me that I was myself the subject of the book: a church, a quartet, the rivalry between Francis I. and Charles V.

I had long gone to bed early. Sometimes, no sooner was my candle out than my eyes would close so quickly that I hadn’t even time to say to myself: "I’m going to sleep." And a half-hour later the thought that it was time to look for sleep would wake me up; I wanted to put down the volume that I believed I still had in my hands and blow out my light; I hadn’t stopped, while asleep, from thinking about what I had just read, but these thoughts had taken on a rather particular turn. It seemed to me as if I was myself of what the book spoke: an abbey, a quartet, the rivalry between Francis I and Charles-Quint. This belief survived for a few seconds after my waking; it did not shock my reason, but weighed down like scales upon my eyes, which prevented them from realizing that the candlestick was not lit. Then it began to become unintelligible to me, as after metempsychosis the thoughts of an earlier existence are; the subject of the book separated itself from me, I was free to apply myself or not; immediately I regained sight and was surprised at finding around me a darkness, sweet and restful for my eyes, but perhaps even more so for my mind, which it appeared as something without cause, incomprehensible, like something truly obscure.
