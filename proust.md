For years, I went to bed early. Sometimes, barely as my candle flame extinguished, my eyes would close so quickly that I couldn’t even say to myself, “I am falling asleep.” And a half hour later, the thought that it was time for sleep would wake me; I wanted to place the volume I believed to still have in my hands and blow away my light. I hadn't stopped while sleeping from pondering what I had read, but these thoughts took a special turn: I felt as if I was myself the subject of the book – an church, a quartet, the rivalry of François Ier and Charles-Quint. This belief survived for only a few seconds before my awakening; it did not contradict my reason, but weighed on my eyes like scales and prevented me from realizing that the candle had been left off.  Then, it began to become unintelligible, as after a reincarnation the thoughts of an earlier existence – the subject of the book detached itself from me; I was free to apply myself to it or not. As soon as I regained sight, I was amazed to find around me a dark, soothing and restful obscurity for my eyes, but perhaps even more for my mind. To which it appeared as an inexplicable thing, without cause, incomprehensible, like something really obscure. I wondered what time it might be; I could hear the whistle of trains that from far or near, like the call of a bird in a forest, spanning distances, described the vast expanse of the deserted countryside where the traveler hastened toward the next station; and the small path he follows will be etched in his memory by the excitement for new places, unusual acts, the recent conversation and the farewells beneath the foreign lamp that still follows him in silence during the night, the proximity of a return.

For a long time, I went to bed early. Sometimes, as soon as my candle was extinguished, my eyes would close so quickly that I didn't even have time to say to myself, "I'm falling asleep." And half an hour later, the thought that it was time for sleep would wake me up; I wanted to put down the volume that I thought I still held in my hands and blow out my light. But I hadn't stopped, even while sleeping, from reflecting on what I had just read, but these reflections had taken on a rather peculiar turn; it seemed to me that I myself was what the book was talking about: a church, a quartet, the rivalry of Francis I and Charles V. This belief persisted for a few seconds after my awakening; it didn't shock my reason, but weighed on my eyes like scales, preventing them from realizing that the candle holder wasn't lit. Then it began to become unintelligible to me, like after reincarnation, the thoughts of a previous existence; the subject of the book distanced itself from me, I was free to apply myself to it or not; as soon as I regained my sight, I was quite astonished to find myself surrounded by an obscurity, sweet and restful for my eyes, but perhaps even more so for my mind, which perceived it as something without cause, incomprehensible, like something truly obscure. I wondered what time it might be; I heard the whistle of trains that, at varying distances, like the song of a bird in a forest, conveyed to me the extent of the deserted countryside where the traveler hastens towards the next station; and the small path he follows is going to be etched into his memory by the excitement that it owes to new places, unaccustomed acts, recent conversation and goodbyes under the foreign lamp that still follows him in the silence of the night, to the near sweetness of his return.

I was a man of late hours for a long time. Sometimes, as soon as my candle went out, I closed my eyes so quickly that I didn't even have the time to think, "I'm falling asleep." And yet half an hour after, the thought of having to look for sleep again would wake me up; I wanted to put down the book I thought I was still holding in my hands and blow out my light. But as soon as I fell asleep, I kept on thinking about what I had read, but these thoughts took a rather peculiar turn; it seemed to me that I was myself the subject of the book: an orchestra, a church, the rivalry between Francis and Charles V. This illusion lasted for several seconds after waking up; it didn't clash with my reason, but weighed like scales on my eyes, preventing them from realizing that the candle wasn't lit. Then it began to become incomprehensible, just as the thoughts of a past existence can become unintelligible after transmigration; the subject of the book detached itself from me, I was free to apply myself to it or not. Immediately I recovered my sight and I was amazed at finding around me an obscurity that was sweet and restful for my eyes, but perhaps even more so for my mind which saw in it something without cause, incomprehensible, something truly obscure. I wondered what time it could be; I heard the whistle of trains, distant or near, like a bird's song in a forest, measuring the distances and describing to me the vastness of an empty countryside where travelers rush towards the next station; and the little road they follow will remain etched into their memory by the excitement that they owe to new places, unusual actions, recent conversation and the goodbyes under a foreign lamp that still accompany them in the silence of the night, as well as the softness of the impending return.

For a long time, I went to bed early. Sometimes, barely had I extinguished my candle, my eyes would close so quickly that I wouldn't have the time to say to myself: "I'm falling asleep." And, half an hour later, the thought that it was time to seek sleep would wake me up; I wanted to put down the book I believed I still held in my hands and blow out my light; during my sleep, I hadn't stopped making reflections on what I had just read, but these reflections had taken a particular turn; it seemed to me that I myself was what was being spoken of in the book: a church, a string quartet, the rivalry between Francis I and Charles V. This belief would survive for a few seconds after my waking; it wouldn't contradict my reason, but weighed like scales on my eyes and prevented them from understanding that the candlewick was not lit. Then it would begin to become unintelligible to me, like the thoughts of a previous existence after metempsychosis; the subject of the book would detach itself from me, I would be free to apply myself to it or not; immediately, I would regain my sight and I would be quite surprised to find around me an obscurity, sweet and restful for my eyes, but perhaps even more so for my mind, which appeared to it as a thing without cause, incomprehensible, like a truly dark thing. I would wonder what time it could be; I would hear the whistling of trains, more or less distant, like the song of a bird in a forest, emphasizing distances, describing the extent of the deserted countryside where the traveler hurries towards the next station; and the little path he follows will be engraved in his memory by the excitement he owes to new places, to unusual acts, to recent conversation and goodbyes under a foreign lamp that still follow him in the silence of the night, to the sweetness of the upcoming return.
