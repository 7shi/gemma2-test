Here's the translation and breakdown:

**Original sentence:** The world is full of beauty.

**Translation:** Le monde est plein de beauté.

Breakdown:

* "The" = Le (indefinite article, masculine form)
* "world" = monde (borrowed from Latin, with a slight change in spelling to adapt to French phonology and grammar)
* "is" = est (third person singular of the verb être, meaning "to be")
* "full" = plein (adjective, agreeing with the noun "monde" in gender and number)
* "of" = de (preposition, indicating possession or origin)
* "beauty" = beauté (borrowed from Latin, with a slight change in spelling to adapt to French phonology and grammar)

Note: In French, the word "monde" can be both masculine and feminine, but when referring to a place or concept, it's typically masculine. That's why we use the indefinite article "le" instead of "la".
