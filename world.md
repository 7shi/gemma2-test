Here's the translation with a breakdown:

**Original sentence:** "The world is full of beauty."

**French translation:** "Le monde est plein de beauté."

Breakdown:

* **"The world"** is translated to **"le monde"**, which is the French equivalent.
* **"is"** is translated to **"est"**, which is the verb "to be" in French, agreeing with the subject "le monde".
* **"full of beauty"** is translated to **"plein de beauté"**. Here's why:
	+ **"full"** is translated to **"plein"**, which means "full" or "entirely". In this context, it's used as an adjective to describe the noun "beauté".
	+ **"of"** is not a direct translation in French. Instead, we use the preposition **"de"**, which is similar to the English word "of".
	+ **"beauty"** is translated to **"beauté"**, which is the feminine form of the adjective.

So, when you put it all together, you get: "Le monde est plein de beauté."
