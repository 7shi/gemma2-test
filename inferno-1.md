	+ "Mezzo" means "middle"
	+ "Del cammin" is a possessive form, meaning "of the journey"
	+ "Di nostra vita" means "of our life", with "nostra" being the possessive adjective for "our" (as in, belonging to us)
* **mi ritrovai**: I found myself
	+ "Mi" is the first-person singular pronoun, equivalent to "I" or "me"

I found myself through a dark wood,
because the right path was lost."
