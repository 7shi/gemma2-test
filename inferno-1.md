**Translation:**

"In the middle of life's journey, I found myself in a dark wood, because the straight path was lost."


**Breakdown:**

* **Nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita:** This translates to "in the middle of the walk of our life," or more literally, "in the midst of our life's journey." It sets up the situation and indicates that something has gone wrong.

* **per una selva oscura:** This translates to "through a dark wood"

The "lost straight path" represents a sense of alienation, a feeling of being off-course in life. This is further explored throughout the poem.

In the middle of our life's journey, I found myself lost in a dark wood,
