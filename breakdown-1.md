Here's the translation into French, broken down:

**Original sentence:** "The world is full of beauty."
**French translation:** "Le monde est plein de beaut√©."
**Breakdown:**

* **"The world"** translates to **"le monde"**, with the definite article **"le"** used because it's a specific, singular noun.
* **"is"** translates to **"est"**, which is the third person singular form of the verb "to be".
* **"full"** translates to **"plein"**, but in this context we use **"plenus"** (the adjective) becomes **"plein(e)"**, and then we add the article **"de"** to mean "of" or "with".
* **"of beauty"** translates to **"de beaut√©"**, with the preposition **"de"** used to indicate possession or an attribute.

So, when you combine these elements, you get: **"Le monde est plein de beaut√©."**

Here's the translation with a breakdown:

**Original sentence:** The world is full of beauty.
**French translation:** Le monde est rempli de beaut√©.

Breakdown:

* "The world" = **le monde**
	+ This is a direct translation, where we replace "world" with its French equivalent.
* "is" = **est**
	+ This verb remains the same in English and French, and it's used to link the subject (le monde) to the predicate (rempli de beaut√©).
* "full of beauty" = **rempli de beaut√©**
	+ This is a literal translation of "full of", where we use the adjective "plein" instead. However, in this context, it's more idiomatic to use "rempli" to convey the idea that something is filled or overflowing with something else.
* "beauty" = **de beaut√©**
	+ This is a possessive form of the noun "beaut√©", which means beauty. The preposition "of" is translated as "de".
